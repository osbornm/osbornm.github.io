One of my new years resolutions will be to post some sort of code tip at least once a week. :/ Hopefully I will be able to pull this off and provide some good code tips and tricks.  If you have any yourself and you would like to share let me know. I am always looking for more ways to seem better than other coders errrr I mean be more productive.  Well till then Happy Holidays! </p>
