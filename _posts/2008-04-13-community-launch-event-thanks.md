<p>I wanted to thank everyone who came out to the Community Launch and listened to my presentation or pretended to listen. If you didn't come I spoke on the new features of SQL Server 2008.  With in the next few months I will be presenting again on SQL Server 2008 but with in depth examples and walk through's.  </p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:fb3a1972-4489-4e52-abe7-25a00bb07fdf:dc9f0de0-6daf-468f-a0ea-edeff7872e2a" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">   <p>If you are interested a copy of my slide deck can be found <a href="http://www.osbornm.com/blog/files/CommunityLaunchEventThanks_A03/SQLServer2008.zip" target="_blank">here</a></p> </div>
