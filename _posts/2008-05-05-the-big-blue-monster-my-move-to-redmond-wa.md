For those of you who do not know yet, I have been presented with a once in a life time opportunity.  Starting in June, I will be working for the Big Blue Monster, that is right Microsoft.  I will be moving to Redmond, WA and working on the UIFX server side team.  That includes ASP.NET, AJAX.NET, and Silverlight.  All the work I will be doing with be for version 4.0 of the framework.  I can't wait to get started, this should be a great experience for me and I should be able to learn so much! The picture is of the building I will be working in on campus.</p>
