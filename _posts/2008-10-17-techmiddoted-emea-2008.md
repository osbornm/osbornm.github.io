Well it’s official I will be going to Tech·Ed EMEA this year.  This will be my first time in Spain so it should be fun.  I will be working the ASP.NET booth for the developer portion of the conference, November 10th through the 14th.  If your going to be there look me up at the booth.  If there is anything you want to find out while I’m in Spain or at Tech·Ed let me know.  Any ideas for a small 20-30 minute talk?  If you’re interested there is still time to register and make the trip!
