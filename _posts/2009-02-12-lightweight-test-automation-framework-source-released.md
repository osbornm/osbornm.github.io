<p>The Asp.NET QA team has been working to make what we do and our processes more visible to our customers.  Two major things we have done to increase this are, releasing the Lightweight Test Automation Framework binaries with a sample to Codeplex.com and starting our <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/asptest">ASP.NET QA Blog</a>.  Well, over the last week we reached another milestone by releasing the source to the Lightweight Test Automation Framework on Codeplex.com.  This is the first time we have tried to do something like this on the ASP.NET QA team and we are very excited.  Visit <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=22739">Codeplex.com</a> and check it out for yourself!</p>  <p>Items Updated in the February Update of the Lightweight Test Automation Framework include</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Lightweight%20Test%20Automation%20Framework%20Road%20Map">Lightweight Test Automation Framework road map</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Lightweight%20Test%20Automation%20Framework%20release%20notes">Lightweight Test Automation Framework release notes</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=22739">Lightweight Test Automation Framework for ASP.NET Samples</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=22739">Lightweight Test Automation Framework for ASP.NET Source</a> </li> </ul>  <p>Thanks go out to all those who have helped to get this release out the door, with a special thanks to the lead developer Federico Silva Armas.</p>
