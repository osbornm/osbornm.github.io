It is my pleasure to announce to you the official launch of the <a href="http://www.codingqa.com/">Coding QA Podcast</a>. Federico and I have been working on this for several months and have already released four shows with a fifth waiting to be edited.  <a href="http://www.codingqa.com">Coding QA</a> is a weekly show about testing from the trenches. Federico and I are members of the ASP.NET QA team, and in this podcast we share our views about everything that has to do with testing and our experience of being the front line testers of a web platform. This is just one of several ways the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/asptest">QA team</a> is engaging with our customers and we have received positive feedback.  So please, visit the site, <a href="http://www.codingqa.com/">tune in</a>, and let us know what you think.
