Okay everyone, here is the deal, the ASP.NET QA Team has a position open and we are looking for the stealthiest ninja we can find! We are looking for someone who is able to help evolve the team processes, improve our tooling, and join us in the trenches as we test one of the best technologies out there. Overall the team is responsible for ASP.NET WebForms, ASP.NET MVC, Microsoft AJAX, and a whole slew of other technologies

We would like to find someone that shares our passion for our technology and our trade and someone that has spent sometime in the trenches. So if this sounds like something you’re interested in pick up your best uniform from the dry cleaner, polish your throwing stars, and visit our <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/JobDetails.aspx?jid=6745&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">job posting</a>.
