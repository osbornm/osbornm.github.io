That’s right you read the title right the ASP.NET QA team is once again hosting ninja try outs. We are looking for someone who is able to help evolve the team processes, improve our tooling, and join us in the trenches as we test one of the best technologies out there. Overall the team is responsible for ASP.NET WebForms, ASP.NET MVC, Microsoft AJAX, and a whole slew of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet">other technologies</a>. Our technologies can be found in numerous large scale web sites such as <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace.com</a>, <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell.com</a> and <a href="http://deals.woot.com/">Deals.Woot.com</a>.

Once again we would like to find someone that shares our passion for our technology and our trade and someone that has spent sometime in the trenches. So if this sounds like something you’re interested in polish your nun chucks, practice your disappearing skills, and slice your way through our <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/JobDetails.aspx?ss=&amp;pg=0&amp;so=&amp;rw=1&amp;jid=9679&amp;jlang=EN">job posting</a>. In the meantime while your sword is out for sharpening send Mark Berryman (one of our managers) an <a href="mailto:markberr@microsoft.com?subject=SDET Position">email</a>.

PS: If you listen to the <a href="http://www.codingqa.com/">Coding QA</a> podcast you can get a good feel for what it is like being the frontline testing ninjas for ASP.NET. We had a great turn out last time and please feel free submit your resume again it can’t hurt.
