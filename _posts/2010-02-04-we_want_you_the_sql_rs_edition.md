The SQL Server Reporting Services (SQL-RS) Team is looking for the brightest and best testers out there. The SQL-RS team is responsible for the Microsoft Chart Control (Included in .NET 4), the Report Viewer, the Map Control, and the Gauge Control. I personally worked with the SQL-RS test team when they were shipping the Microsoft Chart Control for ASP.NET and they have a lot of bright and fun people over there. The next big thing for this team is to create Silverlight versions of these controls and increase integration in SharePoint and Office. So if this sounds like something you would like to test head over the the <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/JobDetails.aspx?ss=&amp;pg=0&amp;so=&amp;rw=1&amp;jid=12043&amp;jlang=EN" target="_blank">job posting</a> and submit your resume.
