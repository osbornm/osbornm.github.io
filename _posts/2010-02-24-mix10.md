So I decided that I am going to make the trip out to Las Vegas for MIX10. The cool thing about going to MIX this year is that I am going completely on my own as an attendee not a Microsoft Employee. So that means I Actually get to have fun the whole time not work during the whole thing. There are a lot of great speaker and to be honest I’m super excited to get to go learn about that that doesn’t really have to do with my daily job, like Windows Phone 7 Series development. I really haven’t had a chance to branch out try developing on other things, so this should be fun. Plus MIX10 was scheduled at the best time to be in Vegas, over St. Patty’s Day! I’m heading out the weekend before so if you’re going to be there drop me a line. Also, I think I might try to bring some of the recording equipment so if you’re interested in being on the <a href="http://www.codingqa.com">Coding QA podcast</a> let me know.
