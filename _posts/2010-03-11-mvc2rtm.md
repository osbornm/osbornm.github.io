My involvement in MVC 2 started almost a year ago, and it has been one crazy year! For me this is a rather important release because it was really the first major project I have ever worked on and my first Microsoft project to RTM. I have grown leaps and bounds over this last year and learned more than I ever thought I could. I had the privilege of working with some of the smartest people I know and to be quite frank it was rather humbling. My hat goes off to each and everyone of them for having to put up with me and not going postal. Okay so yes enough of that emotional stuff and on to the interesting stuff MVC 2.

Okay so I am sure there will be numerous other posts from the likes of <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/03/11/asp-net-mvc-2-released.aspx">The GU™</a> and <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2010/03/11/aspnet-mvc2-released.aspx">Phil Haack</a> about MVC 2 and what is new in it so I’m not going to go in depth but i would like to call out a few features that I think are the big ones.

Okay so I know you are all hyped up now and can’t wait to install it on all your server I must ask a question of you? Why are you still reading my post? Go download it, seriously stop reading and go install it. If you’re still reading I must say that looking back on everything it feels great to say that MVC 2 is RTM! Once again thanks to everyone on the team for a great time!
