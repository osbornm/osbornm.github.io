<em>UPDATE:</em> I figured it was time do the obligatory “what’s in my laptop bag” post. If you have been following my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/osbornm">twitter stream</a> you might have seen that I just purchased a <a href="http://twitter.com/osbornm/status/12247721777">new MacBook Pro</a> and I figured it was time to get a new laptop bag as well. Previously I had the a Microsoft Ogio bag, basically the same as the <a href="http://www.ogio.com/product/view/27/Hip-Hop">Ogio Hip Hop</a>. After some strong recommendations from my friends I decided on a <a href="http://www.tombihn.com">Tom Bihn</a> bag for the new one. For those not familiar with Tom Bihn they are awesome bags with awesome attention to detail. I ended up choosing the black <a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/300/TB0825">Super Ego</a> bag with the appropriate gray <a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/300/TB0300">Brain Cell</a> insert. So to make a short story long, having to switch everything over to the new bag I figured it would be the perfect time to do this post.
