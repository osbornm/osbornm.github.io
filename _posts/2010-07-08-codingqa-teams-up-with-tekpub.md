Today is an exciting day for the <a title="Coding QA Podcast" href="http://www.codingqa.com" target="_blank" rel="">Coding QA</a> Podcast! I am proud to announce that <a title="Coding QA Podcast" href="http://www.codingqa.com" target="_blank" rel="">Coding QA</a> has teamed up with <a href="http://www.tekpub.com">TekPub</a> to give-a-way some licenses for TekPub to our listeners. This has been in the works for some time now and we wanted to find some creative a way to give these licenses away. To us the standard send us an email and we will draw a name out of a hat just did not seem to cut it. I know you’re sitting on the edge of your seat and asking “How then do I get these?” Well given that we are a podcast all about testing we figured what better way than to make you test something. Given that both Federico and I have been working on the newly released WebMatrix we figured that this would be the perfect thing to give our listeners to test. I’d like to take a second and make sure that I make this very clear so listen up. This is NOT in any way, shape, or form connected with Microsoft Corp.

<strong>Goal</strong>: Find the most Interesting bugs possible in WebMatrix

<strong>What</strong>: TekPub is going to give 1st and 2nd place a yearlong subscription and 3rd thru 10th place a 30 day subscription

<strong>How</strong>: Open a bug on <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/site1112/">Microsoft Connect</a> and <a href="mailto:giveaway@codingqa.com">email us</a> (<a href="mailto:giveaway@codingqa.com">giveaway@codingqa.com</a>) with a link to the bug

<strong>When</strong>: We will gather up all the entries on Sept 17th, 2010 and then pick the top 10

Okay so your probably asking yourself what in the world makes up an interesting bug? Well this is a bit subjective so we have come up with some criteria to give you some kind of idea. These are just a few of the criteria and its doesn’t mean that if your bug doesn’t fit all of these then its not an interesting bug with a chance of getting a license. This list is just meant to give you some kind of guide on how we will be picking the top 10.
<ul>
    <li>A majority of users will run into the bug. This means that it is not an extreme edge case.</li>
    <li>Some form of data loss occurs because of the bug. This can be end user data loss or developer data loss.</li>
    <li>The issue is a bug in functionality not the design of the functionality.</li>
    <li>The bug must be a result of the framework code not the implementation of the framework code by the developer.</li>
    <li>Must not be a duplicate. First bug submitted wins. Bugs and issues already called out in the readme would be considered duplicates.</li>
    <li>We must be able to reproduce the bug. This means it’s in your best interest to provide good repro steps or even a repro site.</li>
</ul>
Examples of Interesting bugs that could win you a TekPub license
<ul>
    <li>When I use the following code the CSHTML parser goes into an infinite loop.</li>
    <li>Using the following steps I can get elevation of privileges.</li>
    <li>Using the following steps my face melted off. See Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</li>
</ul>
Examples of bugs that won’t win you a TekPub license but are still bugs.
<ul>
    <li>The following error message has a misspelled word.</li>
    <li>When all 6 of the planets and 2 planetoids align and only on this one really old non-supported machine this code doesn’t work.</li>
</ul>
Okay so what are you waiting for? Why haven’t you download WebMatrix and started finding bugs? You can enter as many bugs as you like but you can only win one license. We know all of you testers out there are going to try to work the system (that's what testers do) but please don’t. This is a reward we wanted to give to our listeners for your support and we would hate to have to call you out. Happy hunting!
