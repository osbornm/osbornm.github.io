Today I am excited to announce that I have joined the Dark Side and by Dark Side I mean the developer team here at Microsoft. Many of you know that for the past two and half years I have worked on the ASP.NET team as a Software Development Engineer in Test or SDET. It has been an awesome experience and I enjoyed every minute of it, however my true passion is writing production code and that is why I have decided to make the switch to a Software Development Engineer or SDE.

So what did I do while I was a SDET? I worked on several products that have been shipped. I started out on the team working on the ASP.NET WebForms mainly the <a href="http://blog.osbornm.com/archive/2009/01/06/asp.net-4.0-clientid-overview-again.aspx">ClientID feature in 4.0</a>. Then I moved to the <a href="http://blog.osbornm.com/category/24.aspx">MVC 2</a> team where I was able to experience the entire lifecycle. Most recently I worked on both <a title="View all post tagged with ASP.NET WebPages" href="http://blog.osbornm.com/category/29.aspx">ASP.NET WebPages</a> and <a href="http://www.nuget.org">NuGet</a>. One of my favorite products I worked on while on the QA team was <a href="http://blog.osbornm.com/category/20.aspx">LTAF</a>! For those of you that don’t know that is a in process test framework that the ASP.NET QA team created and uses. In my time on the QA team I also created a podcast called <a title="Coding QA Podcast" href="http://www.CodingQA.com">Coding QA</a>. The focus of the show was to explain how we test software on the ASP.NET team and also to let me vent about my frustrations. Okay so what will I be working on now? In the near future I will be working on the vNext of the <a href="http://blog.osbornm.com/category/24.aspx">ASP.NET MVC</a> framework as well as vNext of <a title="View all post tagged with ASP.NET WebPages" href="http://blog.osbornm.com/category/29.aspx">ASP.NET WebPages</a>. I will also continue to contribute to <a href="http://www.nuget.org">NuGet</a> with what little free time I will have left.

Overall, it really doesn’t seem like much has changed given that I am on the same team, working on the same products, setting in the same office, but I am looking forward to all the new and exciting opportunities that I will have as a SDE! Also, that means that there is even more openings on the QA team so if your interested check them out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdevtools/archive/2010/08/10/we-are-hiring.aspx">here</a>. Trust me the ASP.NET QA team isn’t just a bunch of button clickers its a lot of fun, check out <a title="Coding QA Podcast" href="http://www.CodingQA.com">Coding QA</a> if you don’t believe me.
