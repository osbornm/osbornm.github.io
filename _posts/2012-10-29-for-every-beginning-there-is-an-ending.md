Today I would like announce that November 2nd, 2012 will be my last day at Microsoft. My journey at Microsoft started almost [4 and a half years ago]({% post_url 2008-05-05-the-big-blue-monster-my-move-to-redmond-wa%}), on June 1st, 2008 when I moved from Salt Lake City, Utah. I had recently finished college and was working at a small startup and needed a change so off to Microsoft I went. I started on the ASP.NET team as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) and in February of 2011 I officially made [the switch]({% post_url 2011-02-23-joing-the-dark-side %}) from SDET to Software Development Engineer (SDE). During my time at Microsoft I have worked on WebForms, MVC 2/3/4, WebPages 1/2, NuGet, and the HTML based Azure Management Portal. So basically a little bit of everything AAPT (Azure Application Platform Team) has to offer. Additionally, I have been lucky enough to get to travel and speak at [several conferences](/talks), some of you may have even seen some of my talks. I am so grateful for the opportunities and experience that Microsoft has given to me over the last four and a half years. As for the new beginning that comes from this end, I have decided to take a position with a smaller / startup company (details to come with time). I will still continue, as much as possible, to contribute to NuGet as well as continue to blog (I know I haven’t for awhile) about Microsoft technologies and everything else tech based.

**[ Update: Where am I going? ]**

Over the last week, or so, I have got a lot of questions about where I was heading to. I personally felt a little wrong giving publicity to a different company when I hadn’t started working there or was still working at my previous company. Well that all ends today, I would like to announce that I will be starting at [Tier 3](tier3.com) tomorrow morning (11/12). I look forward to getting to work with some of the industries best and brightest, learning Exponentially along the way.
