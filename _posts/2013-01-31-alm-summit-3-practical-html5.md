I recently gave a talk at the ALM Summit on Practical HTML5. If you are thinking about using this cool new hipster thing called HTML5 but you have to support downlevel browsers I highly recommend checking this talk out.  Slides and Demos are posted right now and the video recording will be posted once the ALM Summit gets around to encoding it.
