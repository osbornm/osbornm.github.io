Today I’d like to announce that I’ve joined [Conga](https://getconga.com). I will be focused on improving the UI/UX and making their breadth of product offerings feel more like on cohesive unit. I will again be working with/for many of the same people I did at Tier 3. In fact, most all of the executive leadership team is the same.

I’m excited to get the opportunity to help make the group of Conga products the most user friendly painless Salesforce plugins available. While Salesforce plugs aren’t the sexiest thing they almost always have horrible UI/UX and that is something I am passionate about.
