## My Bookshelf 2023

I started off 2023 with a goal of read (or listening) to at least one book a week. Well as December approaches it looks like it will be closer to one every two weeks. Even though I didn’t reach my goal I couldn’t be happier with the outcome. The wealth of knowledge I’ve gained this year has been amazing.
