        <p class="lead">I am a full stack developer focusing primarily on web technologies with a passion for user experience design. I am a firm believer of Open Source software and <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile software development.</a></p>
<p>I worked at Microsoft for four years focusing on developer tools and frameworks. During my time there I helped ship several projects including <a href="http://www.asp.net">ASP.NET</a> 3.5/4/4.5, <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">MVC</a> 2/3/4, <a href="https://www.nuget.org">NuGet</a>. I also was heavily involved in the development on version 2 of the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=522337">Azure Portal</a>, the HTML version.
  After leaving Microsoft I joined a small cloud start up called Tier 3 that has since been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/19/centurylink-buys-tier3-the-infrasructure-platform-and-advanced-cloud-management-provider/">acquired by CenturyLink</a>.
  At Tier 3 / CenturyLink I created a UI/UX design library, based on <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">atomic design</a>, called <a href="https://assets.ctl.io/cyclops">Cyclops</a>. I now work for concur.</p>

        <div class="col-md-9 col-md-pull-3">
            <p class="lead">Through out my journey in my professional career a passion of mine has been how users interact with software or user experiences. Too often powerful software becomes difficult to use and unavailable to the masses because the developers do not take the time to stop and think about the diverse group of people that will be using it.<p>
            <p>Software, just like any other entity you interact with, should and does invoke an emotional response. Sometimes that response is joy and some times it is anger. As developers it is our job to make sure the response is one of joy not anger.</p>
            <p>To often the little things go unnoticed or are simply not fixed in user experiences. These little things add up like a thousand tiny paper cuts to invoke an emotional response from a user. Why is that people says apps suck five minutes after downloading them? Most of the time it’s the little things.</p>

        <p class="lead">During my career one thing I have always enjoyed has been to give presentations. I enjoy teaching and sharing my knowledge with others perhaps that’s why I also enjoy sharing my code via open source.  I enjoy everything from the big stages at conferences like //BUILD to the lunchroom brown bags at the office.</p>

            <p>I won’t drag on and on about CrossFit but it has drastically changed my life. Long story shorty I was well on my way to becoming just another over weight border obese American statistic when I found CrossFit. I have since lost over 100 pounds of fat and gained 40 pounds of lean muscle. If you would like to know more I did a <a href="https://osbornhm.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/guest-post-my-crossfit-journey-by-mr-osborn/">guest post</a> on my wife’s blog.

        <p class="lead">The maker movement bug recently bit me and bit me hard. I always loved to take things apart and see how they were made much to the dismay of my parents because I was never very good and putting them back together.</p>

        <p>Recently I have been trying my hand at 3D printing, laser cutting, circuit design, and other random marker type things. Keep an eye on my blog for maker posts.
