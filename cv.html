      <h2>User Experience</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p class="lead">Through out my journey in my professional career a passion of mine has been how users interact with software or user experiences. Too often powerful software becomes difficult to use and unavailable to the masses because the developers do not take the time to stop and think about the diverse group of people that will be using it.<p>
      <p>Software, just like any other entity you interact with, should and does invoke an emotional response. Sometimes that response is joy and some times it is anger. As developers it is our job to make sure the response is one of joy not anger.</p>
      <p>To often the little things go unnoticed or are simply not fixed in user experiences. These little things add up like a thousand tiny paper cuts to invoke an emotional response from a user. Why is that people say apps suck five minutes after downloading them? Most of the time it’s the little things.</p>
