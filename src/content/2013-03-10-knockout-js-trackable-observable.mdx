Here is another common helper function/type that I use frequently. I often find myself writing 
edit forms with knockout and it seems that I always want to have a cancel button on those edit 
forms. TrackableObservable tracks its original value so that you can call the reset and it will 
revert back to the original value. I have seen a few implementations of this type but they 
all seemed to wait for a "commit" action before changing the value, this means that if you are 
taking a dependency on that value for other parts of the from (think a checkbox that turns more 
UI on or off) you would need to call commit or depended on the "uncommitted" value property. I 
choose to make mine an optimistic "commit" and have the ability to revert. This makes the 
implementation simpler and also taking dependencies on the TrackableObservable easier. Let me 
know what you think.
